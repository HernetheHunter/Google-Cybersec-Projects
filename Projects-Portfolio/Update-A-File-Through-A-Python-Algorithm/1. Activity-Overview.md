# Activity Overview

In this activity, you will create a new portfolio document to demonstrate your experience using Python to develop algorithms that involve opening files and parsing their contents. You can add this document to your cybersecurity portfolio, which you can share with prospective employers or recruiters. 

To create your portfolio document, you will review a scenario and follow a series of steps. This scenario is connected to the "Create Another Algorithm" lab that you have just completed. You will explain the code you developed in that lab, and this will help you prepare for future job interviews and other steps in the hiring process.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.
