# Control categories

## Control categories

Controls within cybersecurity are grouped into three main categories:

-   Administrative/Managerial controls

-   Technical controls

-   Physical controls

**Administrative/Managerial controls** address the human component of
cybersecurity. These controls include policies and procedures that
define how an organization manages data and clearly defines employee
responsibilities, including their role in protecting the organization.
While administrative controls are typically policy based, the
enforcement of those policies may require the use of technical or
physical controls.

**Technical controls** consist of solutions such as firewalls, intrusion
detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), antivirus
(AV) products, encryption, etc. Technical controls can be used in a
number of ways to meet organizational goals and objectives.

**Physical controls** include door locks, cabinet locks, surveillance
cameras, badge readers, etc. They are used to limit physical access to
physical assets by unauthorized personnel.

## Control types

Control types include, but are not limited to:

1.  Preventative

2.  Corrective

3.  Detective

4.  Deterrent

These controls work together to provide defense in depth and protect
assets. **Preventative controls** are designed to prevent an incident
from occurring in the first place. **Corrective controls** are used to
restore an asset after an incident. **Detective controls** are
implemented to determine whether an incident has occurred or is in
progress. **Deterrent controls** are designed to discourage attacks.

Review the following charts for specific details about each type of
control and its purpose.
