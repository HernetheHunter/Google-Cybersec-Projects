## Analysis

The network analyzer output shows repeated DNS queries from the client machine (192.51.100.15) to the DNS server (203.0.113.2), with each query failing in the same way.

### Key observations:

1. **DNS Query Attempts**: The client repeatedly attempts to resolve the domain "yummyrecipesforme.com" by sending DNS requests to port 53 at the IP address 203.0.113.2.

2. **Error Responses**: Each DNS query is met with an ICMP "port unreachable" error message from the DNS server.

3. **Pattern**: The client retries the DNS lookup approximately every 2 minutes, but continues to receive the same error.

## Affected Protocol

Based on the analyzer output, the affected protocol is **DNS (Domain Name System)** which runs on **UDP port 53**. The evidence indicates that:

- DNS resolution is failing because UDP port 53 on the DNS server (203.0.113.2) is unreachable
- Without successful DNS resolution, clients cannot translate the domain name "yummyrecipesforme.com" to an IP address
- This prevents any subsequent HTTPS connection to the web server

## Possible Causes

Several potential causes could explain this issue:

1. The DNS server at 203.0.113.2 may be offline or malfunctioning
2. A firewall might be blocking UDP port 53 traffic to the DNS server
3. The DNS service on the server may not be running
4. Network routing issues might exist between clients and the DNS server
5. The DNS server configuration may have been altered, leaving port 53 closed

## Next Steps for Remediation

To resolve this issue, the following steps should be taken:

1. Verify if the DNS server at 203.0.113.2 is operational
2. Check firewall rules to ensure UDP port 53 traffic is permitted
3. Confirm the DNS service is running on the server
4. Test network connectivity between clients and the DNS server
5. Consider configuring clients to use alternative DNS servers temporarily
6. Investigate recent changes to network infrastructure or DNS server configuration

By addressing the DNS resolution failure, clients should be able to successfully access the website again.
