# Attack Analysis Guidelines

Reflect on the types of network intrusion attacks that you have learned about in this course so far. As a security analyst, identifying the type of network attack based on the incident is the first step to managing the attack and preventing similar attacks in the future.

Here are some questions to consider when determining what type of attack occurred:

* What do you currently understand about network attacks?
* Which type of attack would likely result in the symptoms described in the scenario? 
* What is the difference between a denial of service (DoS) and distributed denial of service (DDoS)? 
* Why is the website taking a long time to load and reporting a connection timeout error?

Review the Wireshark reading from step 2 and try to identify patterns in the logged network traffic. Analyze the patterns to determine which type of network attack occurred. Write your analysis in section one of the Cybersecurity incident report template provided.
