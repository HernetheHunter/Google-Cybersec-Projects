# Change File Permissions

<b>chmod u+rwx,g+rwx,o+rwx login_sessions.txt</b>

If you wanted to take all the permissions away, you could use

<b>chmod u-rwx,g-rwx,o-rwx login_sessions.txt</b>

Another way to assign these permissions is to use the equals sign (=) in this first argument. Using = with chmod sets, or assigns, the permissions exactly as specified. For example, the following command would set read permissions for login_sessions.txt for user, group, and other:

<b>chmod u=r,g=r,o=r login_sessions.txt</b>

This command overwrites existing permissions. For instance, if the user previously had write permissions, these write permissions are removed after you specify only read permissions with =. 

# Change File Permissions On A Hidden File

<b>chmod u-rwx,g-rwx,o-rwx .bonuses.txt</b>

This command removes all permissions from Group and Other while giving full permissions to User

# Change Directory Permissions

<b>chmod u-rwx,g-rwx,o-rwx bonuses_folder</b>

This command removes all permissions from Group and Other while giving full permissions to User for the <b>bonuses_folder</b>
