# Activity Overview

In this activity, you will create a new portfolio document to demonstrate your experience using Linux commands to manage file permissions. You can add this document to your cybersecurity portfolio, which you can share with prospective employers or recruiters.

To create your portfolio document, you will review a scenario and follow a series of steps. This scenario is connected to the lab you have just completed about how to examine and manage file permissions. You will explain the commands you used in that lab, and this will help you prepare for future job interviews and other steps in the hiring process.

Be sure to complete this activity and answer the questions that follow before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.
